/* EXERCISE 1
 Enumerate and describe the main datatypes in JavaScript. Try to explain the concepts as you were speaking to a 12 years old.
*/
/*
Number: (i)The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.
        (ii)There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -,

String:(i)- Are for storing and manipulating text.
       (ii) Is zero or more characters written inside quotes.

Bolean:(i) Represents one of two values: true or false.

Null: (i) Represents an empty or non existent value.

Undefined: (i) Means a variable has been declared
           (ii) but the content of that variable has not yet been defined.

     */

/* EXERCISE 2
 Try to describe what a variable is, in your own words.
*/

/* A variable is a container that stores data and is declared with let keyword */

/* EXERCISE 3
 Write the code to execute an addition (a sum) of the numbers 12 and 20.
*/

let number1 = 12;
let number2 = 20;
let numbersum = number1 + number2;
console.log("Exercise 3: the answer given to me is...." + numbersum)



/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 4
 Create a variable named x and assign to it the number 12.
*/
let x = 12;
console.log("Exercise 4: X is equal to " + x)
/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 5
 Create a variable called name and assign to it the string "John Doe".
*/
let name = "John Doe";
console.log("Exercise 5: His name is... " +  name)
/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 6
 Execute a subtraction between the number 12 and the variable x you declared before (which is storing the value 12).
*/
let number6 = 12;
let numbersume6 = number6 - x;
console.log("Exercise 6: the answer given to me is...." + numbersume6)
/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 7
 Create two variables: name1 and name2. Assign to name1 the string "john", and to name2 the string "John" (this one has a capital J!)
 Verify that name1 is different from name2 (HINT: check their equality to be false).
 Finally, verify that the equality between name1 and name2 becomes true if both are lowercase (without changing the value of name2).
*/
let name1 = "john"
let name2 = "John"
(name1 === name2)

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 8
 Create a variable named x, and assign to it a numeric value less than 10.
 Write the code to print the literal value of x (ex.: if x is 1, it should print "one", if x is 5 it should print "five" etc.).
*/



/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 9
 [Extra] Assign a value to a variable using a ternary operator (this topic has not been covered during lesson yet,
 try to search it by yourself, tomorrow morning we'll discuss it together!)
